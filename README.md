# pip-purge: uninstall everything in your virtualenv.

I don't like destroying and recreating virtualenvs to get a clean `pip freeze`.

## Usage

    $ pip-purge
    Found 12 packages, uninstalling...
    Purged!

That's basically it.

## Installation

    $ pip install pip-purge

Make sure to only run in a virtualenv ;)
